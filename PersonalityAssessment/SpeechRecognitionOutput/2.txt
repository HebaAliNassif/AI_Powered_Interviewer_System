I’m motivated to find a position that will grow my skills, and a friend forwarded me your job description because he saw that the job posting mentions building and leading a cross-functional team. I'd like to get the hands-on experience of how things work in an office environment and build professional working relationships with people of all ages. I am still learning but I can vouch that I am a fast learner, always eager to improve and learn new skills. I believe this position will help build confidence one needs and help in personal growth. I’m confident that I could get up to speed very quickly and start contributing results for you in this role.
