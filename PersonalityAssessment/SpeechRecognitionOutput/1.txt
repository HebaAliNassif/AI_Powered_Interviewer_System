My name is Maram, I’m 22 years old and I recently graduated from Cairo University with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering. While there, I learned a lot of theories in subjects and worked on several projects. I also participated in school activities and maintained a good GPA. I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge to practice. I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in university and get some hands-on work experience. I am highly self-disciplined, very organized and I always come prepared. I just like to know the plan rather than be spontaneous.
