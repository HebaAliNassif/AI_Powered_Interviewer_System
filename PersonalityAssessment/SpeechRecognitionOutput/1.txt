My name is Maram, I’m 22 years old and I recently graduated from Cairo University with a Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering. While there, I learned a lot of theories in subjects and worked on several projects. I also participated in school activities and maintained a GPA of 3.6. I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge to practice. While I don’t have any real-life work experience, I’ve had a lot of exposure to the business environment. A lot of my courses involved working with real companies to solve real problems. Now, I’m looking to leverage everything I’ve learned in university and get some hands-on work experience. I am highly self-disciplined and do not worry I am very organized and always come prepared. I just like to know the plan rather than be spontaneous.'
