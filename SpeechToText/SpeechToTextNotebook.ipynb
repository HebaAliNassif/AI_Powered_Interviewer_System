      "Make your english sound more natural and some expressions for basic conversation. If you want to greet someone in a formal way. You can say. Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. No they goodnight is only used when going to bed so you would never use in a formal situation. To greet someone informally. You could say hi. Hey. Hey there. How's it going. What's up. How are you. So english speakers especially americans will usually say how are you as part of every conversation. They're not really asking how you are it's just part of the greeting. So give only a short answer. Ways to say how are you could be. How are you. How are you doing. How's it going. How do you ben. What's up. Stop. You can respond by saying. Good thanks and you. Creep. Ion thanks. Pretty good. Alright. Sanotra all these answers are short. If someone says what's up. Usually you would say not much nothing. Not a whole lot. Example of a conversation. Hello. Hi. How's it going. Good and you. Fine thanks. Great. Use another one. Hey. Hey there. What's up. Not much you. Nothing. Introduce yourself give your name. I'm. And say your name. Your responses. Nice to meet you. Example. I'm either. Nice to meet you eva and janelle. Nice to meet you. Everything high an introduction you can just continue the conversation. For someone you don't know you can. What do you do. Let me in. What they spend most of their time doing. Principal. What do you do. I work in a bank. And you. I'm a student. Oh i see. What do you do. I work in a restaurant. And you. Ice-t home with my kids. Oh ok. When someone is talking to you. You can use these words to show interest in a conversation. For instance. Really. How interesting. Oh i see. Oh ok. If you want to show someone that you agree with what they're saying. Berate. Oh definitely. .Naturally. Yeah for sure. When someone is talking to you and you want to react to something they said the tab e. You can say. Oh that's great. How nice. Wow really. I'm happy to hear that. If somebody is telling you a funny or amusing story you can say. Oh that's too funny. That's hysterical. That cracks me up. If someone is telling you a surprising or shocking an unexpected story you can say. No way. Really. Seriously. That's unreal. If someone is telling you a sad or upsetting story. You can say. Oh no really. That's too bad. That's a shame. I'm sorry to hear that. For example. I'm studying finance. Really. I will graduate next month. Oh that's great. My car broke down oh no really. It will cost a lot to fix. That's too bad. So when you're ready to end the conversation and you want to go. You can introduce the fact that you're ready to go. You do it by saying something like. I better be on my way. I'm going to get going. Well i'm off. Turn the conversation in a formal setting and to be polite. For someone you've just met you say. It was nice meeting you. The response would be. Same to you. If you're saying goodbye to someone you know what you've been talking to. Princeton. A work colleague or a friend you don't know very well you could say. It was nice seeing you. It was nice talking to you. Always nice to see you. The response would be. Likewise. Same to you. Actually say goodbye say goodbye. Bye. See you. Talk to you later. Take it easy or have a nice day. Have a nice day is really used only for formal situations really don't know someone very well. Example. Alright i better go. Ok. See you later. Take care. It was nice seeing you. Same here. Calculator. Bye. We hope this video was useful to you. If you liked it please click like and subscribe you can check out more videos from education world here. \n"
